Html, css and js project - QUIZ APP

About
This project is a quiz based project. There are multiple choice questions and the project has 4 types of different choices. Your task is to complete the quiz by attempting all the questions. For attempting the question you have to select one option then submit it. After submitting all the questions you will get the score card of your performance.
The skills i have used in this project are:-
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

In the html part i have given the division for question types, options, answer of each question and lastly the submit button.

In the css part I style the main division of question and options and also give the hover button of submit. For the option part I have given radio property for easily selecting the questions.

I have mainly worked in the javascript part, it's a very important part of this project. I define the question type, option type, answer and submit button by initialising in a variable. I have defined the functions for question loading. Also worked on a scorecard with the help of score count and question count by using innerHTML property of js. Lastly define the play again button and hand emoji in javascript.

Learning
By using javascript very precisely I have learned more about javascript functionality. How it worked dynamatily in real world entities.
